"""Local authorization gate for IBM Verify OBO token exchange.

Compares the ``groups`` claim embedded in a caller's ``subject_token`` against
the scope set being requested. Raises :class:`VerifyAuthorizationError` (mapped
to HTTP 403 in the API layer) when the caller's groups do not entitle every
requested scope. The check fails closed: missing/malformed claims and unknown
scopes both deny.
